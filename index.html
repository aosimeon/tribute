                            6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major
                            climate on Earth.

                            creating a strain that responds well to fertalizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.

                            modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that
                            GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals
                            for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
